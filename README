Check for EC for comments, for ESHA for insight on where to read the relevant code

Right now, we have the two level scheduling as two pools, active and pending and Round robin inner level. 
This is good for our large warp, but we need to change it for allowing us to choose the threads in the warp dynamically.

I think I found the place to change the stuff for implementing the concept of choosing the threads in a warp dynamically.
Still need to figure out a way to be able to update the counters correctly. 
Once that is done, we can get to work and implement the large warp.

Have a separate reg file for each sub warp. Read the code for the reg file update.

Once that is done, adding our actual idea should be really easy.

Each time a warp is stalled, it is kicked back to pending and a new warp comes in to replace it.
I dont know if the branch divergence part of the paper has been implemented. I think not.


important functions: 
ptx_reg_t ptx_thread_info::get_operand_value( 
vi cuda-sim/instructions.cc
ptx_reg_t ptx_thread_info::get_reg( const symbol *reg )


Things to do :

1- In execute function, divide into subwarps and increment our own variable between cycles. Display this extra variable with the other stats. 
:
2- Break the 128 bit mask into smaller sub warps  and get them into groups , just based on more 1's

3- Once 2 is implemented, make sub warps based on the coalescing.
